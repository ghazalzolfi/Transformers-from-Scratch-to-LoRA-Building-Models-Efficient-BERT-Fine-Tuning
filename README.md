# Transformer Implementation and BERT Fine-tuning (NLP)

This repository covers two advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks: implementing the Transformer architecture from scratch and fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Both implementations utilize PyTorch, providing hands-on experience with modern NLP model architectures and fine-tuning techniques.

### Project Overview:

### 1. Transformer Architecture from Scratch:
- **Objective**: Implement the Transformer model's encoder and decoder architectures, highlighting key components such as multi-head self-attention and positional embeddings.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Created custom classes for encoder and decoder blocks, attention mechanisms, and embedding layers.
  - Applied input embeddings normalized by the model dimensionality, ensuring efficient training and numerical stability.

### 2. BERT Fine-tuning with LoRA:
- **Objective**: Efficiently fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on specific downstream NLP tasks.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Utilized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), significantly reducing the computational resources required for fine-tuning.
  - Demonstrated improved efficiency without sacrificing performance, making the approach highly suitable for resource-constrained environments.

### Key Components Explained:
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Central to the Transformer model, enabling effective capture of contextual relationships within sequences.
- **Embeddings and Positional Encoding**: Methods for converting textual data into meaningful numerical representations.
- **LoRA Technique**: Explained the benefits and theoretical underpinnings of low-rank fine-tuning methods for pre-trained models.

### Evaluation and Results:
- Assessed performance improvements achieved through Transformer implementation and BERT fine-tuning using standard NLP evaluation metrics.
- Provided practical insights into model efficiency, generalization capabilities, and computational savings using LoRA.

### Libraries and Tools Used:
- Python
- PyTorch (Model development and fine-tuning)
- HuggingFace (Dataset and Tokenization)
- WandB (Experiment tracking and monitoring)
- TensorBoard (Visualization and logging)

This project offers extensive practical and theoretical knowledge on modern NLP architectures and efficient fine-tuning methods, essential for building and deploying powerful NLP applications.
